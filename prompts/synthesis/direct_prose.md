# Direct Prose Refinement

Transform this text to natural, human-written prose. Apply these principles:

## Core Transformations

### 1. Remove AI-Specific Language Patterns
- Eliminate: "rich/vibrant tapestry", "nestled", "boasts", "serves as", "testament to", "plays a vital role", "underscores", "highlights", "reflects broader", "enduring legacy", "indelible mark", "deeply rooted"
- Remove superficial analyses ending with -ing phrases: "highlighting...", "emphasizing...", "showcasing...", "underscoring..."
- Delete didactic disclaimers: "it's important to note", "it's crucial to remember"
- Cut promotional language: "stunning", "groundbreaking", "continues to captivate"

### 2. Eliminate Formulaic Structures
- Remove "In conclusion", "In summary", "Overall" section endings
- Delete "Challenges and Future Prospects" formulaic sections that follow the pattern: "Despite its [positive words]... faces challenges... Despite these challenges..."
- Avoid negative parallelisms: "not only...but also", "It's not just about X, it's about Y"
- Reduce rule-of-three constructions: "adjective, adjective, and adjective"

### 3. Make Content More Specific
- Replace generic statements with concrete details
- Convert "symbolism" claims to factual statements
- Remove emphasis on notability ("featured in major outlets", "independent coverage")
- Delete vague attributions: "Observers note", "Industry reports suggest"
- Specify rather than generalize

### 4. Adjust Writing Style
- Use straight quotes (") not curly quotes ("")
- Reduce em dashes (—) significantly; use commas, colons, or split sentences
- Vary sentence structure naturally (don't force patterns)
- Allow some elegant repetition instead of forced variation
- Write in active voice when natural
- Make paragraphs uneven lengths

### 5. Remove Collaborative/Meta Elements
- Delete: "I hope this helps", "Let me know", "Would you like...", "Here is a...", "more detailed breakdown"
- Remove knowledge cutoff disclaimers: "as of [date]", "based on available information"
- Cut any chatbot communication artifacts

## Writing Principles

**Be Direct**: Get to the point. Avoid throat-clearing.

**Be Specific**: "invented the first train-coupling device" not "a revolutionary titan of industry"

**Be Natural**: Accept minor imperfections. Real writing isn't perfectly balanced.

**Be Varied**: Mix short and long sentences. Don't force patterns.

**Be Modest**: Understate rather than overstate importance.

**Be Concrete**: Facts over analyses. Show, don't tell significance.

## Paragraph Structure
- Start with main point, not buildup
- No summary sentences at paragraph ends
- Uneven paragraph lengths
- Direct statements without hedging or emphasis

## What to Keep
- Factual information and data
- Proper nouns and specific details
- Technical accuracy
- Citations (but fix any formatting)

## Output Format
Provide only the transformed text. No explanations, no commentary about changes made, no meta-discussion.
