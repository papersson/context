Summarize by presenting the core ideas directly as conceptual reality, not as someone's argument or thesis. Write as if you're explaining how something actually works, not reporting what someone said about it. No meta-framing ('the paper argues,' 'the author contends,' 'the framework suggests'). No references to the source, document, or creator. Present the logic chain naturally so insights cascade into each other, making the implications self-evident without labeling them as such. Write it so a brilliant reader encounters the idea itself, not a report about the idea. Use active voice and present tense. Make abstract concepts concrete through their mechanisms and dynamics.
