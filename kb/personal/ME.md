# ME.md — Personal Profile & Context

> Work profile moved to `kb/work/context.md`. This file focuses on health, habits, and daily rhythms.

## Physical Stats & Goals
- **Height**: 194 cm
- **Weight**: 100 kg (decently built)
- **Goal**: Lose 5-10 kg fat while maintaining/increasing muscle
- **Training**: 5-6x/week gym (strength focus)
- **Cardio**: Daily 60-min walks


## Daily Rhythm Constraints
- **Wake**: ~06:00
- **Last Meal**: ~17:00 (important!)
- **Sleep**: 22:00 (not 23:00)
- **Morning Flow**: Wake → Water + YouTube (60 min) → Gym → Recovery (1-2h) → Shower → Deep Work (2h) → Walk (60 min)

## Core Challenges
1. **Energy**: Feeling tired all the time, especially after deep work
2. **Focus**: Overfocusing on programming/work
3. **Habits**: 15-year morning porn habit to break
4. **Consistency**: Sticking to gym and walking routine
5. **Nutrition**: Extremely restrictive palette (mainly carbs & comfort foods)
6. **Emotional**: Handle extreme lows, weekend motivation harder
7. **Life Logistics**: Pay off 30k SEK loan, consider freelancing for extra income

## Food Reality
**Likes**: Rice, pasta, potatoes, lasagna, bolognese, burgers, pizza, fried chicken, fried rice, chips, chocolate
**Strategy**: Don't overhaul - just add protein/fiber to existing meals
**Key Success**: Sunday meal prep (when motivated)

## What Works
- Morning YouTube buffer helps gym readiness
- Deep work blocks are highly productive (but draining)
- Structure and templates reduce decision fatigue
- Short-term goals (monthly max)

## Environment Hacks
- Phone charger in kitchen (not bedroom)
- Gym clothes laid out night before
- Water by bedside
- Templates for different day types

## Success Metrics
- Sleep: 7+ hours average (quality: 1-5 scale)
- Mood: Daily 1-10 scale
- Workouts: 5-6 completed/week
- Study: 15+ focused hours/month
- Job apps: 5+ sent/month
- No-porn streak: Track daily


## Personal Preferences
- No emojis in metrics - use numbers/scales
- Watch shows/movies during main meal (17:00)
- Low energy after 17-18:00 - plan only one moderate task max for evenings
- Prefer concise schedules over granular time blocks
- Learning: Short, high-quality tutorials; dislike fluff
- Weekend motivation harder - journaling helps
- Planning rhythm: Need clear plans, struggle with long-range focus
