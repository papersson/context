## Search Strategy for Knowledge Base

**Always search first, read selectively.** Transcripts are token-heavy - smart search saves ~87% of tokens.

**Protocol:**
1. Start with targeted searches: `Grep "pattern" -C 3`
2. Only read full documents when confirmed necessary
3. For complex multi-step searches, use Task tool with search agents

**Key patterns:**
- Decisions/actions: `"agreed|decided|next steps|action item"`
- Timelines: `"deliverable|milestone|week|deadline"`
- Tracks: `"BA track|software engineer|data analyst"`
- Platform: `"certification|web app|FTP|portal"`
- Speaker + topic: `"Winston|Patrik|Steve" + keyword`
